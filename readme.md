> **NOTE:** This is a work-in-progress, though if you find it interesting feel free to make suggestions on how you might improve it. I'll be using this app as the basis for a few courses I'm working on.

## Get Started

npm run dev

**TODO:** Screen reader testing
**TODO:** Keyboard grid navigation
**TODO:** Cross-browser testing
